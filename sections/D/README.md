# Mentorship

## Option 1: Student Progress

> As a mentor, you are invested in every studentâ€™s progress, as well as
> responsible for ensuring high task completion and graduation rates for our
> bootcamps.
> In the following hypothetical situation, you have 20 part-time students on
> a 6-month bootcamp. Of this group, 5 students are 2 weeks behind on
> their expected progress in the bootcamp, 10 are at risk of falling behind (if
> they do not complete their next task in the next 2 days, they will be behind)
> and 5 are ahead of expected progress. Please lay out an intervention plan
> to get the 5 lagging students back on track whilst ensuring that the 10
> at-risk students do not fall behind and the 5 students that are ahead are
> not negatively impacted.

### OPTION 1: STRATEGY

1.  #### Lagging students
    - Check in with the 5 lagging students: In order to understand how to best help the 5 lagging students get back on
      track, it is important to first check in with them and try to understand their individual struggles. This could
      range
      from lack of understanding of the material to personal issues that have impeded their progress.
    - Develop individualized plans: Once I have identified the struggles of each of the 5 lagging students, I should
      develop individualized plans that address their personal challenges. This could include short-term goals,
      additional
      resources that will help the student catch up to their expected progress.

2. #### At-risk students
    - Monitor the 10 at-risk students: It is also important to keep an eye on the 10 at-risk students to make sure that
      they do not fall behind. I should check in with them regularly and provide resources and extra help as needed to
      ensure they stay on track.
    - Set up group meetings with at-risk students: Meet with the 10 at-risk students in a group setting to discuss their
      progress, identify any issues they have been facing, and brainstorm potential solutions.
    - Create a support network: Encourage the at-risk students to form a support network so that they can help each
      other out.

3.  #### Ahead students
    - Celebrate the ahead students: Celebrate the 5 ahead students by recognizing their accomplishments and providing
      them with additional challenges to ensure they stay on track.

## Option 3: Student Feedback

> Handling student concerns is an important part of the mentorship role.
> In the following scenario, you have provided feedback to a student in a
> code review for one of their submissions. After reading the feedback, the
> student responds in an irate manner claiming that you have provided
> feedback that does not provide any value, is generic and seems like you
> copy-pasted feedback just to complete the review. You did in fact provide
> non-generic, personalised and actionable feedback. On top of this, the
> student has also made a complaint on social media about the poor quality
> of your review. Please explain how you would handle this situation.

### OPTION 3: STRATEGY

1. First and foremost, I would maintain a professional and respectful demeanor when responding to the student. I would
   thank them for bringing their concerns to my attention and acknowledge that they are unhappy with the feedback that I
   have provided. I would then explain that my intention was to provide constructive feedback that would improve their
   code and offer to have a further discussion about the feedback if they would like to.

2. I would then apologize for any confusion or frustration caused by the feedback and explain that I believe the
   feedback was not only personalised and actionable, but also accurate and valuable. I would also explain that I
   understand their frustration and offer to look at the feedback again to help identify any areas of improvement.

3. I would also explain that I am happy to engage in further discussion with the student to help address any
   issues or misunderstandings they may have.

4. Finally, I would use this opportunity to reflect on my comments and feedback and consider ways I can improve my
   communication style and avoid misunderstandings in the future.
