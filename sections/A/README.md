## CODE REVIEW

> This section simulates a typical interaction that you might have with a student.
You will be given a question that a hypothetical student asks and the student’s
submitted code. You will be required to answer the question and review their
code’s correctness, efficiency, style and documentation.

Based on the student’s submitted code found in `submission.rb` under student_question folder, I performed a detailed review found in `REVIEW.md` file.
